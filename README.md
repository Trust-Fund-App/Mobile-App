## What is Trust Fund?

Trust Fund is a decentralized savings platform that empowers individuals to securely build wealth and earn rewards.

Trust Fund offers a decentralized and permissionless platform that empowers individuals to convert their local fiat currency into stablecoins and securely save through smart contracts. Unlike conventional banks, where individuals have little control or transparency over how their funds are used. Trust Fund gives users complete ownership of their savings. They can save securely and reclaim their funds at the end of the set saving period.

Beyond security, Trust Fund introduces gamification and rewards to encourage user engagement and financial discipline. Users are rewarded for maintaining their savings goals and can track their progress, making saving both enjoyable and rewarding.
